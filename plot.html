            <p class="article__p"><em>Abbott Elementary</em> follows the lives of several teachers at Willard R. Abbott Elementary School, an underfunded public school in Philadelphia. Filmed as a documentary, the show records the countless challenges (and silly antics) that take place throughout the school year. The show focuses primarily on Janine Teagues, a second-grade teacher whose positivity can get her into trouble. She greatly admires seasoned kindergarden teacher, Barbara Howard, and badly wants to be respected by her. Sometimes, Janine will go to Mrs. Schemmenti for some creative problem solving that may or may not involve the mob or any number of other questionable characters. Of course, there is a "Will they; won't they?" storyline between Janine and Gregory Eddie, a substitute who eventually was hired full-time. Everyone around them can tell they should be more than friends but they continue to be blind to it.

            <p class="article__p"><em>Abbott Elementary</em> offers a balance between social commentary about the state of the education system in America and well-written humor. The commentary is subtle but thought-provoking, revealing some tough truths about education that non-teachers are likely not aware of.
