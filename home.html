                Our favorite show is ABC's <em>Abbott Elementary</em>. Created by Quinta Bronson, this mocumentary-style comedy follows the lives of five teachers, their principle, and custodian in a Philadelphia elementary school. <em>Abbott Elementary</em> first aired in December 2021 and recently aired the finale of its second season. It was renewed for a third season, and production was expected to start in May 2023, but the writers' strike has cased delays. Season one was nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards and won two. It was also nominated for five Golden Globes and won three.
