One of the challenges we faced was understanding branches: their practical purpose, how to implement them, and how they interacted with each other and the main branch. We somewhat figured it out as we went along but did not feel very confident in using them. We noticed that when a change was made to the CSS file on one branch, those changes were not reflected in the same file on a different branch, despite being saved locally and pushed correctly to the repository.

Otherwise, we both were able to successfully code our assigned pages and push them to the repository to create a mobile-friendly site.
