            <h1>Setting</h1>
            <p class="article__p"><em>Abbott Elementary</em>, also referred to as Abbott or the Willard R. Abbott Elementary School, is an imaginary public elementary school situated in Philadelphia. During World War II, it was constructed as a bomb shelter. Drawing inspiration from the harsh realities of Philadelphia's public schools, Abbott Elementary highlights the challenging circumstances that exist. Philadelphia, being the poorest among the <a href="#">top 10 largest cities in the country</a>, has long grappled with persistent underfunding in its school district. Additionally, the average age of schools in Philadelphia exceeds 70 years, lacking central air conditioning and being constructed with materials like lead and asbestos. These conditions have led to both temporary and prolonged closures of the buildings, further exacerbating the situation. </p>
